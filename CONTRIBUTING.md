# Contribution guide

## Code lifecycle

This git repository follows the Gitflow pattern, so make sure to follow the convention.

For instance, create a branch `feature/my-change-title` from `develop`, once good enough to be shared and reviewed create a Pull Request targetting `develop`.

## Code convention

For bash/shell script files, follow the conventions from [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).
